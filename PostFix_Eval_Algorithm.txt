1. Start reading the postfix expression from left to right.
2. If the element(symbol) is an operand then
    PUSH it into the stack.
3. If the element(symbol) is an operator then
    POP two operands from the stack(OP1,OP2).
    Evaluate the expression OP1 symbol OP2.
    PUSH the result into the stack.
4. If no more elements in the expression then
    POP the result from the stack.
   else
    Go to step 1.
5. END
